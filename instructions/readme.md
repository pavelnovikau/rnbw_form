# Technical Specification for RNBW Survey Landing Page

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a landing page survey for the RNBW project to assess user interest in a new device. The landing page will feature a header image with a short description of the device, followed by a series of survey questions. Upon submission, the survey responses will be emailed to a designated recipient. This project will be implemented using the Cursor platform, leveraging free and widely adopted libraries and frameworks.

## 2. Objectives

- **User Engagement:** Present a visually appealing landing page that captures user interest.
- **Survey Collection:** Provide a clear and concise survey form for users to express their opinions.
- **Response Handling:** Automatically send an email with the user responses upon form submission.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Use free, open-source libraries for both front-end development and email sending.

## 3. Scope

- **Front-End:** A responsive, user-friendly landing page.
  - Header section with device image and description.
  - Survey form with multiple questions.
  - Visual feedback on successful submission.
- **Back-End:** A lightweight service to process form data and send emails.
  - Validate and sanitize form inputs.
  - Integrate with a free email sending library.
- **Integration:** Ensure seamless communication between the landing page and the email sending service.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Landing Page

- **Header Section:**
  - Display a high-quality header image of the device.
  - Include a short description of the device (max 2–3 sentences).
  
- **Survey Form:**
  - Present a series of questions (e.g., “Would you use this device?”, “What features are most appealing?”, etc.).
  - Use form controls such as radio buttons, checkboxes, text inputs, and dropdowns as needed.
  - Provide client-side validation to ensure required fields are filled.

- **Submission Process:**
  - On clicking the "Submit" button, validate the form inputs.
  - Display a loading indicator during processing.
  - If successful, show a confirmation message to the user.
  - If there is an error (e.g., email sending failure), display an appropriate error message.

### 4.2 Email Sending

- **Functionality:**
  - Collect and format survey responses into a clear email message.
  - Use a free email sending library (e.g., Nodemailer for Node.js or a similar library if using another back-end language).
  - Send the email to a pre-configured recipient address.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error detection for email sending.
  - Provide feedback to the user if the email fails to send.
  - Log errors for further analysis.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Responsiveness:** The landing page must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Performance:** Optimize assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) for fast load times.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the page follows accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) for users with disabilities.
- **Security:**
  - Use HTTPS for data transmission.
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, or other common vulnerabilities.
  - Consider implementing CAPTCHA if spam submissions become an issue.
- **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and visually appealing.

## 6. Technical Stack

### 6.1 Front-End

- **Framework:** Use a well-known, free, and widely adopted front-end framework such as React or Vue.js.
- **UI Library:** Consider using a free UI component library like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
- **Form Handling:** Utilize client-side form validation libraries (e.g., Formik or Vuelidate).

### 6.2 Back-End / Email Service

- **Platform:** Implement the server-side component using Node.js, Python, or another supported language on Cursor.
- **Email Library:** Use a free email sending library such as:
  - **Node.js:** [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)
  - **Python:** [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) or other free SMTP libraries.
- **Deployment:** The back-end service can be deployed as a serverless function or a lightweight API endpoint.

### 6.3 Integration with Cursor

- **Development:** Leverage the Cursor platform for development and deployment.
- **Libraries:** Use only free and open-source libraries.
- **Documentation:** Follow Cursor’s best practices for project structure and code quality.

## 7. Architecture and Data Flow

1. **User Interaction:**
   - User visits the landing page.
   - The page loads the header image and description, then displays the survey form.
2. **Data Submission:**
   - User fills out the survey form.
   - Upon submission, the form data is validated on the client side.
3. **Processing and Email Sending:**
   - Validated data is sent via an AJAX call to the back-end API.
   - The back-end service processes the data and uses the free email sending library to dispatch an email containing the survey responses.
4. **Feedback:**
   - The user receives immediate feedback on the success or failure of the submission.
   - Error messages are logged for further review.

## 8. UI/UX Requirements

- **Visual Design:** 
  - Clean and modern design with emphasis on the device image.
  - Use clear typography and ample whitespace.
- **User Flow:** 
  - Simple navigation from the header to the survey.
  - Clear call-to-action buttons.
- **Responsive Layout:** 
  - Ensure all elements adapt to various screen sizes.

## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for both front-end components and back-end email functionality.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that the landing page successfully communicates with the back-end service.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct testing sessions with target users to ensure the survey is intuitive and meets expectations.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure the landing page loads within acceptable time limits on various devices and networks.

## 10. Deployment and Maintenance

- **Deployment:** 
  - Use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the landing page and back-end service.
  - Host the front-end on a reliable web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
- **Monitoring:** 
  - Set up monitoring for error logging, especially for the email service.
  - Regularly update dependencies and libraries.
- **Documentation:** 
  - Provide comprehensive documentation covering setup, deployment, and maintenance procedures.

## 11. Deliverables

- **Source Code:** Fully commented source code for both front-end and back-end.
- **Documentation:** Installation, configuration, and usage documentation.
- **Testing Reports:** Documentation of test cases and results.
- **Deployment Guide:** Step-by-step instructions for deploying the landing page and associated services.

## 12. Timeline

- **Planning & Design:** 1 week
- **Development:** 2–3 weeks
- **Testing:** 1 week
- **Deployment & Review:** 1 week
